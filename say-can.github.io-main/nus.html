                    In this work, we propose MASS (My ASSistant), a method that employs an LLM as an intelligent interactive assistant in assisting surgeons in automating surgical robots to perform surgical tasks. Based on simple human-level instructions given by the surgeon, the LLM intelligently sequences pre-defined surgical actions to complete a surgical task. The proposed method is validated on 2 different simulation environments to perform 3 different surgical tasks. Serving as a bridge between the surgeon and the surgical robot, this setup essentially simplifies the automation of surgical robots, improving human-robot interaction in a surgical environment.

                    Approach
                </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                Imagine a robot operating in a kitchen that is capable of executing skills such as "pick up the coffee cup" or "go to the sink".
To get the robot to use these skills to perform a complex task (e.g. "I spilled my drink, can you help?"), the user could manually break it up into steps consisting of these atomic commands. 
			However,this would be exceedingly tedious. A language model can split the high-level instruction ("I spilled my drink, can you help?") into sub-tasks, but it cannot do that effectively unless it has the context of what the robot is capable of given the abilities, current state of the robot and its environment.
<br><br>
When querying existing large language models, we see that a language model queried with "I spilled my drink, can you help?" may respond with "You could try using a vaccuum cleaner" or "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spill it".
                <p style="text-align:center;">
        	    <image src="img/gpt3-cropped2.png" class="img-responsive">
                </p>
While these responses sound reasonable, they are not feasible to execute with the robot's capabilities in its current environment.  
<br><br>
The main principle that we use to connect LLMs to physical tasks is to observe that, in addition of asking the LLM to simply interpret an instruction, we can use it to score the likelihood that an individual skill makes progress towards completing the high-level instruction.
Furthermore, if each skill has an accompanying affordance function that quantifies how likely it is to succeed from the current state (such as a learned value function), its value can be used to weight the skill's likelihood.
                <p style="text-align:center;">
        	    <image src="img/saycan-llm.gif" class="img-responsive">
                </p>
<br><br>
Once the skill is selected, we execute it on the robot, the process proceeds by iteratively selecting a task and appending it to the instruction.
Practically, we structure the planning as a dialog between a user and a robot, in which a user provides the high level-instruction, e.g. "How would you bring me a coke can?" and the language model responds with an explicit sequence e.g. "I would: 1. Find a coke can, 2. Pick up the coke can, 3. Bring it to you, 4. Done".  
                <p style="text-align:center;">
        	    <image src="img/saycan.png" class="img-responsive">        	   
                </p>
In summary, given a high-level instruction, SayCan combines probabilities from a language model (representing the probability that a skill is useful for the instruction) with the probabilities from a value function (representing the probability of successfully executing said skill) to select the skill to perform. This emits a skill that is both possible and useful. The process is repeated by appending the selected skill to robot response and querying the models again, until the output step is to terminate.

                    Results
                </h3>
		<p class="text-justify">
		We benchmarked the proposed algorithm Saycan in two scenes, an office kitchen and a mock office kitchen with 101 tasks specified by natural 
			langauge instructions. Below we show some highlights of the results.
		</p>
		
		<p class="text-justify">
			We visualize the decision making process of SayCan. The blue bar indicates (normalized) LLM probability and the red bar 
			indicates (normalized) probability of 
			successful execution of selected skills. The combined score is in green bar, 
			and the algorithm choose the skill with highest combined score. This visualization
			highlights the interpretability of SayCan.
		</p>
		    
		<p class="text-justify">
			Given the task "I spilled my coke, can you bring me something to clean it up?", SayCan successfully planned and executed the following 
			steps 1. Find a sponge 2. Pick up the sponge
			3. Bring it to you 4. Done. As shown below:
	        </p>
                <p style="text-align:center;">
                    <image src="img/qualitative_1.png"  class="img-responsive" height="600px">
                </p>
			
		
		<p class="text-justify">
			However, if we slightly tweak the task to "I spilled my coke, can you bring me a replacement", SayCan planned the following steps instead
			1. Find a coke can 2. Pick up the coke can
			3. Bring it to you 4. Done. This highlights that SayCan is able to leverage the large capacity of LLMs, 
			where their semantic knowledge about the world can be useful both for interpreting instructions
			and understanding how to execute them.
	        </p>
			
		  <p style="text-align:center;">

                </p>
			  
		<p> In the next example, SayCan leverages the ability of the affordances to "override" the language model; though the language model believes picking up the sponge is the right skill, the affordances are aware this isn't possible and instead "find a sponge" is chosen. This highlights the necessity of affordance grounding.

		    The proposed approach achieves an overall plan success rate of 84% and execution success rate of 74% of 101 tasks,  <font color="#5a00b4"> which is 14% and 13% higher than our initial release</font>. For more details, please refer to 
			our paper.  We show that a robot’s performance can be improved simply by enhancing the underlying language model.

		The proposed method can scale to long horizon tasks involving multiple steps, for example, for the task "I spilled my coke on the table,
